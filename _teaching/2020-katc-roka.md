I served as a drill instructor at the Korea Army Training Center in Nonsan.

During my service, I was part of the 29th Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 12th Company, 2nd Platoon, where I trained nine classes of recruits.

I also took on the role of Master Squad Leader, responsible for educating and guiding other squad leaders.

In addition, I worked as a Gate Keeper, listening to and counseling recruits and squad leaders regarding their concerns and difficulties.
