Hi! Iâ€™m Minki Hong, an M.S. student in <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence</span> at Dongguk University, advised by Professor Jihie Kim. I received my B.S. degree in <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</span> from Dongguk University.

My research interests lie in developing AI systems that <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">align with human social norms and values</span>. I focus on the intersection of generative AI, <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">social norms, and bias mitigation</span>, with a particular emphasis on fairness and inclusivity. I am especially fascinated by how cultural and social contexts shape communication and how AI models can better capture these nuances. In addition, I explore methods to <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">improve the quality of generative AI responses in low-resource environments</span>, aiming to make AI more accessible and equitable across diverse linguistic and cultural settings.

I am also deeply interested in <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">eliciting reasoning capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and visionâ€“language models (VLMs)</span>. I find it exciting that different prompting and training strategies can enable smaller models to approach the performance of much larger ones, and I am actively exploring methods to bridge this gap.

Currently, I am spending six months as a visiting researcher at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of Professor Jean Oh. During this period, I am studying the <span class="mm-pill mm-blue">interaction between robotics and generative AI</span>, investigating how these two domains can complement and enrich each other.
