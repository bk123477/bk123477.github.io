Hi! Iâ€™m Minki Hong, an M.S. student in [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence]{: .highlight} at Dongguk University, advised by Professor Jihie Kim. I received my B.S. degree in [Computer Science & Engineering]{: .highlight} from Dongguk University.

My research interests lie in developing AI systems that [align with human social norms and values]{: .highlight}. I focus on the intersection of generative AI, [social norms]{: .highlight}, and [bias mitigation]{: .highlight}, with a particular emphasis on fairness and inclusivity. I am especially fascinated by how cultural and social contexts shape communication and how AI models can better capture these nuances. In addition, I explore methods to [improve the quality of generative AI responses in low-resource environments]{: .highlight}, aiming to make AI more accessible and equitable across diverse linguistic and cultural settings.

I am also deeply interested in [eliciting reasoning capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs)]{: .highlight}. I find it exciting that different prompting and training strategies can enable smaller models to approach the performance of much larger ones, and I am actively exploring methods to bridge this gap.

Currently, I am spending six months as a visiting researcher at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of Professor Jean Oh. During this period, I am studying the [interaction between robotics and generative AI]{: .highlight}, investigating how these two domains can complement and enrich each other.
